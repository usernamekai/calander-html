## What each bit does (html)

The `!DOCTYPE` declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

The `<body>` tag defines the document's body.

The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph.

The `<tr>` tag defines a row in an HTML table.

The  `<th>`  tag defines a header cell in an HTML table.

An HTML table has two kinds of cells:

-   Header cells - contains header information (created with the  `<th>`  element)
-   Data cells - contains data (created with the  [<td>](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/tag_td.asp)  element)

A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns.
	
	- Each table cell is defined by a  `<td>`  and a  `</td>`  tag.

	- Everything between `<td>` and `</td>` are the content of the table cell.

## CSS Syntax

![CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/css/img_selector.gif)

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

>example
In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:
p  {  
color:  red;  
text-align:  center;  
}
>#### Example Explained
>-   `p`  is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: ).
>-   `color`  is a property, and  `red`  is the property value
>-   `text-align`  is a property, and  `center`  is the property value
